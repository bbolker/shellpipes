# shellpipes

An R package for working through Makefile and command lines. Designed to be used with [makestuff](https://github.com/dushoff/makestuff) and specifically with [pipeR.mk](https://github.com/dushoff/makestuff/blob/master/pipeR.mk) (see [code](https://github.com/dushoff/shellpipes.git))

## Installation

From inside R:

`remotes::install_github("dushoff/shellpipes")`

This will fail for old versions of "remotes", because the default branch is now "main" instead of "master". `, ref="main"` before the last paren may well fix this problem, but probably what you want to do is update remotes:

`install_packages("remotes")`

â€¦ and then try again

_Alternative_ If you can't install_github because of permission problems, try:

* [download this zip file](https://github.com/dushoff/shellpipes/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* unzip it
* `R CMD INSTALL shellpipes-main` from the directory where you unzipped.

## Overview

shellpipes is designed to:
* make working with makestuff pipelines easy and transparent
* make it relatively easy to use the same script both in a make pipeline and interactively

shellpipes functions work with a list of filenames that can be specified manually, but is typically specified by either:
* command-line arguments that include the word `shellpipes`
	* these are usually passed by make
* an rpcall() command
	* this command is often auto-generated by make and pasted into the script
	* the rpcall() is ignored if the command-line argument `shellpipes` is present

The idea is that shellpipes expects to _read_ from files in the filename list, and to _write_ to files with the same basename as the target. `pipeR.mk` recognizes that `.Rout` files are made using a shellpipe-friendly call, and that `.rda`, `.rds`, `.Rout.*` and other sorts of files are made as side-effects of `.Rout`.

Some simple functions are listed below.

### Setup

``` R
library(shellpipes) ## to load the package
startGraphics() ## not strictly necessary, but good practice; can also be used to set height and width
## startGraphics() does not do anything in interactive mode unless you over-ride a switch; it's meant to play nicely with interactive users
```

### Reading files (see documentation)

* `loadEnvironments()` loads all environments (typically saved as `.rda`) from the filename list sequentially into the global environment; `getEnvironment()` and `loadEnvironmentList()` do fancier things
* `rdsRead()` returns a single serialized object (typically saved as `.rds`) from the filename list; you can use pattern matching to select if necessary
* `csvRead()` reads a matched csv file using `read_csv()`

### Saving files

* `saveEnvironment()` saves the whole global environment as an `.rda` (using the target name as a base by default)
* `saveVars()` saves selected variables to an `.rda`
* `rdsSave()` saves a single selected variable to an `.rds`
